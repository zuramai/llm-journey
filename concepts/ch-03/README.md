## Recurrent neural networks (RNN) 

Before the transformers, RNN (recurrent neural network) was the most popular neural network that use encoder-decoder architecture.

How RNN works:
- The previous output is fed as the input in the next step.
- It's suitable for sequential data (like stock market price)
- RNN was the popular choice for machine translation.
- Disadvantage: RNN will gradually loss of context if the data is long or complex, so RNN only works fine if the text is short.
