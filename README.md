# LLM Journey

This repository contains my journey of learning to build my own LLM from scratch. The primary source of learning is a book called [Build a Large Language Model](https://www.manning.com/books/build-a-large-language-model-from-scratch) by Sebastian Raschka.

## Project Structure

- `concepts` directory contains my own interpretation of Raschka's explanation in the book, divided by chapters.
- `exercises` directory contains the code to implement my own LLM.
